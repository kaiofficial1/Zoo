    <p style="border: 50px solid black; background-color: black">Our featured animal currently is the emporeor penguin. Did you know Emperor penguins have a unique approach to parenting. After laying a single egg, the female passes it to the male, who incubates it on his feet, nestled in a special brood pouch, while the female goes off to feed in the ocean. This shared responsibility ensures the egg's survival.</p>
